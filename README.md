# EPAP-Audit-Simulation

This project simulates the Enhanced Production Audit Program (EPAP) process using real-world Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) facility metadata. It includes an Excel-based dashboard to visualize deficiencies, track remediation, and assess compliance risks for oil and gas operations.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Data Source**: Alberta Energy Regulator's Facility Cost Centre Listing
- **Scope**: 190+ facilities (pipelines, terminals, gas plants)
- **Simulated Fields**: 
  - Deficiency Found
  - Issue Type
  - Remediation Status
  - Last Proving Date
  - Vent Volume

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, Charts)
- Schematic mapping (manual visualization)
- Randomized formulas for simulating operational data

## 📈 Features

- Simulated EPAP audit conditions and compliance workflows
- Interactive pivot tables to monitor key measurement issues
- Dashboards to identify trends by facility type, region, and audit field
- Schematic-style visual summaries to support remediation tracking

## 🔍 Purpose

This simulation was developed to build familiarity with Alberta’s EPAP audit structure and demonstrate data analysis capabilities for oil and gas measurement operations.
